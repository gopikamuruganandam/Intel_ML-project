A company wants to predict whether a customer will purchase a product based on their age and estimated salary. The company has collected past data and wants to use a Decision Tree Classifier to predict future purchases.

Dataset:
Age	Estimated Salary	Purchased (Target)
22	30000	              0
25	45000	              0
35	60000	              1
45	80000	              1
50	150000	            1
60	120000	            1
30	50000	              0
40	70000	              1
The target column "Purchased" is 1 if the customer bought the product and 0 otherwise.
