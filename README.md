1.A company wants to predict whether a customer will purchase a product based on their age and estimated salary. The company has collected past data and wants to use a Decision Tree Classifier to predict future purchases.

Dataset:
Age	Estimated Salary	Purchased (Target)
22	30000	              0
25	45000	              0
35	60000	              1
45	80000	              1
50	150000	            1
60	120000	            1
30	50000	              0
40	70000	              1
The target column "Purchased" is 1 if the customer bought the product and 0 otherwise.


OUTPUT:
Decision Tree Model Accuracy: 1.0
Prediction for new customer: Not Purchased


2.The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset containing 150 samples of iris flowers categorized into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample is represented by four features:
Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width.
i)To develop a machine learning model using the Decision tree algorithm to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on sepal and petal dimensions.
ii)To develop a machine learning model using the K th cluster algorithm to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on sepal and petal dimensions.
iii)To develop a machine learning model using the Random forest algorithm to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on sepal and petal dimensions.


OUTPUT:
i) Decision Tree Model Accuracy: 1.00
Prediction for new sample: virginica
ii)Predicted Cluster: 0
Prediction for new sample: setosa
iii)Random Forest Model Accuracy: 1.00
Prediction for new sample: virginica
